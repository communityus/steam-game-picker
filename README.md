# Steam Game Picker
Allows you to use OpenID (redirect to steam login page and get a one-time use token) to sign in to your steam account and randomly choose games from your steam library

Uses the awesome repository [passport_steam](https://github.com/liamcurry/passport-steam) for authenticate and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the front-end.

Note: You need to have your profile/games list public to use it (unless you run it with your own API key) -- https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4113-YUDH-6401
